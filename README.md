#Memo To Demo


##Introduction
Memo to Demo is an application for songwriter-producers to organize their original content into task lists. It allows a user to enter information about songs that are in progress, and have all songs display in a list. Then, a user can add a demo to be completed that corresponds with a song in the songs list. Tracks to be completed can be added to each demo. Users can update and delete any information in the application.
